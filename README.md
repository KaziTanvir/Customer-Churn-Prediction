# Customer Churn Prediction

## What is churn?

Churn rate, sometimes known as attrition rate, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company over a given period of time. Churn may also apply to the number of subscribers who cancel or don't renew a subscription. The higher your churn rate, the more customers stop buying from your business.

## Why we need Churn Prediction?

Churn prediction means detecting which customers are likely to leave a service or to cancel a subscription to a service. It is a critical prediction for many businesses because acquiring new clients often costs more than retaining existing ones. The impact of the churn rate is clear, so we need strategies to reduce it. Predicting churn is a good way to create proactive marketing campaigns targeted at the customers that are about to churn.
